      "description": "Pyrite, often referred to as 'fool's gold,' is a metallic mineral known for its striking resemblance to gold, due to its brassy yellow color and metallic luster. This iron sulfide mineral is commonly found in sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks, and forms in cubic or pyritohedral crystals. Despite its appearance, pyrite is not a true precious metal, but rather a common mineral that has long been mined for its iron content and occasionally for sulfur.",
